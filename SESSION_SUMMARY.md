Exact commands you can use to resume (copy/paste friendly)

# checkout the rr-homeassistant feature branch
cd /home/jm/CORTEZ
git fetch origin
git checkout rr-homeassistant

# run the scaffold locally
cd rr-homeassistant
docker compose up --build

# check docs PR status and merge when CI passes
gh pr view 8 --web

# show recent git activity
git log --oneline -n 20
git tag --list

# list open issues
gh issue list --state open

# revert or remove resources (examples)

Notes on continuity and chat context
- This chat conversation is stored in your ChatGPT history (you confirmed). The assistant won't "remember" across sessions unless you reopen this conversation in ChatGPT. To preserve context outside ChatGPT:
  - The `SESSION_SUMMARY.md` file (this file) is committed in the repo on branch `rr-homeassistant` so you have a persistent record.
  - Git/GitHub records (commits, tags, PRs, issues) provide an auditable timeline of actions.
- If you return tomorrow and open a new chat, paste this `SESSION_SUMMARY.md` or link to the PR/issue and I can pick up precisely where we left off.

How I recommend you resume (fast path)
1. Checkout the scaffold branch: `git checkout rr-homeassistant`
2. Run the scaffold locally: `cd rr-homeassistant && docker compose up --build`
3. Review the rr-homeassistant issue: https://github.com/caustic-sam/CORTEZ/issues/9
4. Tell me which task to do next: (a) Harden Dockerfile to official HA image, (b) add CI to build image, (c) migrate config and test, (d) create PR with production-ready manifest.

If you'd like me to continue when you return, open this conversation in ChatGPT and say "resume session" — I'll re-run the summary steps and continue from the branch and task you select.
